# doppler-swarm

Automate synchronization of Docker Swarm services with Doppler.

## Overview

This program integrates with Docker Swarm and Doppler to update services automatically based on changes in environment variables in Doppler.

## Work in Progress

**Note:** This project is currently under development. It may not be feature-complete, and certain aspects may be subject to change.

## Getting Started

1. Configure `config.json` with Doppler tokens and Docker service names.
2. Run with `cargo run`.
3. Witness automated synchronization of secrets, Docker service updates, and real-time monitoring.

Enhance your Docker Swarm deployments with doppler-swarm, simplifying the management of environment variables across services.
